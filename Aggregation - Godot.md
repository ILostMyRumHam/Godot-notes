[[Inheritance - Godot|Inheritance]] and [[Aggregation - Godot|Aggregation]] seem similar but fulfill different purposes

"Aggregation allows you to compose a [[Scenes - Godot|scene]] using other complex scenes, but keeps the scenes separate. It defines a 'has-a' relationship: A human 'has-a' set of eyes, 'has-a' nose, 'has-a' ability to hear."
