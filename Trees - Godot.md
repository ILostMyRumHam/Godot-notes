[[Godot basics]]
A [[Scenes - Godot|scene]] is composed of one or more [[Nodes - Godot|nodes]]. Nodes are your game's smallest building blocks that you arrange into [[Trees - Godot|trees]]. 

All your game's scenes come together in the [[Scene Tree - Godot|scene tree]], literally a tree of scenes. And as scenes are trees of nodes, the scene tree also is a tree of nodes. But it's easier to think of your game in terms of scenes as they can represent characters, weapons, doors, or your user interface.
