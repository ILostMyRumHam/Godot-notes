[[Godot basics]]
All your game's [[Scenes - Godot|Scenes]] come together in theÂ **scene tree**, literally a [[Trees - Godot|tree]] of scenes. And as scenes are trees of nodes, the scene tree also is a tree of nodes. But it's easier to think of your game in terms of scenes as they can represent characters, weapons, doors, or your user interface.

[[Root Node]] = A single node that is at the base of a [[Scene Tree - Godot|scene tree]]
