The while loop keeps running until a specific condition is met or when you decide to break from the loop

A variable number can be used to keep track of how many loops the loop completes

A while loop can run infinitely - if there is not break condition, the programme freezes


>example of an infinite loop:
```GDScript
var number = 0
while number < 10:
	draw_square()
```

a [[For Loops - GDScript|for loop]] is a safer option most of the time

While loops can be used every time there is the need to loop an unknown number of times

Uses of while loops: 
+ Reading and processing a file line by line
+ Processing a constant stream of data
+ Reading code and converting it into instructions
+ Advanced Algorithms
