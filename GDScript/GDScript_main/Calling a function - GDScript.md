Calling a function = giving the computer instructions to execute a [[Functions - GDScript|function]]

>To call a function in GDScript, you write its exact name followed by an open and closed parenthesis

Creating a function is necessary to execute instructions in GDScript

A function call uses the [[Identifier - GDScript|identifier]] to tell the computer to execute all the instructions inside the function as many times as needed
