[[Inheritance - Godot|Inheritance]] and [[Aggregation - Godot|Aggregation]] seem similar but fulfill different purposes

"Inheritance allows you to derive from a [[Scenes - Godot|scene]]: A farmer inherits from the 'human' scene, therefore 'has-a' set of eyes, 'has-a' nose etc. The [[relationship]] is 'is-a'. The farmer 'is-a' human. But the farmer also 'has-a' hat and 'has-a' ability to harvest crops. Changes to the human aggregate to the farmer, but changes to the farmer aren't inherited to the human"
