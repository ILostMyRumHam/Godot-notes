Every game engine revolves around abstractions you use to build your applications. In Godot, a game is a [[Trees - Godot|tree]] of [[Nodes - Godot|nodes]] that you group together into [[Scenes - Godot|scenes]]. You can then wire these nodes so they can communicate using [[Signals - Godot|signals]].

# Godot basic workflow

Nodes are your game's smallest building blocks. You combine them to create [[Scenes - Godot|scenes]] that you then combine and nest into a [[Scene Tree - Godot|scene tree]]. You can then use [[Signals - Godot|signals]] to make nodes react to events in other nodes or different [[Scene Tree - Godot|scene tree]] branches.
